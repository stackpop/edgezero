# Fastly Compute@Edge

Deploy EdgeZero applications to Fastly's Compute@Edge platform using WebAssembly.

## Prerequisites

- [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/#install-the-fastly-cli)
- Rust `wasm32-wasip1` target: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`
- [Viceroy](https://github.com/fastly/Viceroy) for local execution and testing

## Project Setup

When scaffolding with `edgezero new my-app`, the Fastly adapter includes:

```
crates/my-app-adapter-fastly/
├── Cargo.toml
├── fastly.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

### fastly.toml

The Fastly manifest configures your service:

```toml
manifest_version = 2
name = "my-app"
language = "rust"
authors = ["you@example.com"]

[local_server]
  [local_server.backends]
    [local_server.backends."origin"]
    url = "https://your-origin.example.com"
```

### Entrypoint

The Fastly entrypoint wires the adapter:

```rust
use my_app_core::App;

#[fastly::main]
fn main(req: fastly::Request) -> Result<fastly::Response, fastly::Error> {
    edgezero_adapter_fastly::run_app::<App>(req)
}
```

`run_app` reads logging and store config at runtime from `EDGEZERO__*`
environment variables (see
[the migration guide](../manifest-store-migration.md)) and builds
per-id `KV` / `Config` / `Secret` registries from the portable store
metadata baked into `App` by the `app!` macro. No `edgezero.toml` is
loaded by the runtime.

The low-level `dispatch()` helper remains available only for fully manual wiring and does not inject
store metadata. Prefer `run_app` or `dispatch_with_config` for normal use.
`dispatch_with_config_handle` exists for advanced/manual cases where you already have a prepared
`ConfigStoreHandle`.

### Capturing raw-request signals (JA4, H2 fingerprint)

`run_app` converts the `fastly::Request` into a neutral core request before
dispatch. The client IP is carried across automatically — read it via
`FastlyRequestContext` (see [Context Access](#context-access) below). Other
Fastly-only signals that are readable only on the raw request
(`get_tls_ja4()`, `get_client_h2_fingerprint()`) aren't reachable from handlers
by default. Use `run_app_with_request_extensions`, which
runs an app closure against a scratch `Extensions` **before** conversion and
merges the values into the core request — so a `State`/extractor or middleware
can read them:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Ja4(String);

#[fastly::main]
fn main(req: fastly::Request) -> Result<fastly::Response, fastly::Error> {
    edgezero_adapter_fastly::run_app_with_request_extensions::<App, _>(req, |raw, ext| {
        if let Some(ja4) = raw.get_tls_ja4() {
            ext.insert(Ja4(ja4.to_owned()));
        }
    })
}
```

`run_app` is exactly `run_app_with_request_extensions::<App, _>(req, |_, _| {})`.
The closure runs once per request; insert whatever typed values your handlers
need, then read them in a handler via a custom extractor or
`ctx.request().extensions().get::<Ja4>()`.

### Owning your own logging

By default `run_app` initializes the Fastly logger. If your app already installs
a `log` backend, opt out with the platform-neutral `Hooks::owns_logging()` flag —
via the `app!` macro:

```rust
edgezero_core::app!("edgezero.toml", owns_logging = true);
```

or on a hand-written `Hooks` impl (`fn owns_logging() -> bool { true }`). Every
adapter's `run_app` honors it, so the app is responsible for logger setup.

## Building

Build for Fastly's Wasm target:

```bash
# Using the CLI
edgezero build --adapter fastly

# Or directly with cargo
cargo build -p my-app-adapter-fastly --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
```

The compiled Wasm binary is placed in `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/`.

## Local Development

Run locally with Viceroy (Fastly's local simulator):

```bash
# Using the CLI
edgezero serve --adapter fastly

# Or directly
fastly compute serve --skip-build
```

This starts a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:7676`.

## Deployment

Deploy to Fastly Compute@Edge:

```bash
# Using the CLI
edgezero deploy --adapter fastly

# Or directly
fastly compute deploy
```

## Backends

`FastlyOutboundClient` uses deterministic **dynamic backends** derived from the canonical target,
TLS identity, and provider timer budget. You do not predeclare those destinations in
`fastly.toml`, but dynamic backends must be enabled on the deployed Fastly service. The local CLI
cannot prove that service entitlement, so `outbound-http` is BestEffort. A disabled service
returns a typed 502 with an enablement diagnostic.

Fastly also has documented deadline, upload, elastic-budget, batch-isolation, and lazy downstream
streaming limitations. The standard `#[fastly::main]` entrypoint buffers a portable response
stream under the fixed 16 MiB `FASTLY_RESPONSE_STREAM_BUFFER_BYTES` cap. See
[Capabilities](/guide/capabilities) before marking an outbound capability required.

## Logging

Fastly uses endpoint-based logging. Configure logging in `edgezero.toml`:

```toml
[adapters.fastly.logging]
endpoint = "stdout"
level = "info"
echo_stdout = true
```

To initialize logging manually, call `init_logger` with explicit settings:

```rust
use edgezero_adapter_fastly::init_logger;
use log::LevelFilter;

fn main() {
    init_logger("stdout", LevelFilter::Info, true).expect("init logger");
}
```

::: tip Logging status
Fastly logging is wired when you call `init_logger` (or `run_app`); otherwise no logger is installed.
:::

## Config Store

Fastly uses a native Config Store resource link for runtime configuration. Declare logical config
ids in `edgezero.toml`; each id opens its own platform store via
`EDGEZERO__STORES__CONFIG__<ID>__NAME` (default = the logical id):

Because `edgezero_runtime_env` is an account-wide Fastly resource, its stored
keys are scoped by the current service ID:

```text
EDGEZERO__SERVICES__<SERVICE_ID>__STORES__CONFIG__<ID>__NAME
EDGEZERO__SERVICES__<SERVICE_ID>__STORES__CONFIG__<ID>__KEY
```

The runtime obtains `<SERVICE_ID>` from Fastly and translates these entries back
to the portable `EDGEZERO__STORES__*` form. Legacy unscoped entries are ignored
because they have no safe owner when the Config Store is linked to multiple
services. Re-run `edgezero provision --adapter fastly` to write scoped `__NAME`
entries, and rewrite any manually managed adapter, logging, or `__KEY` entries
under the service prefix. Provision writes only the selected service's
namespace; a non-default store-name mapping therefore requires top-level
`service_id` in `fastly.toml` or `FASTLY_SERVICE_ID`. If both are set, they must
match.

Viceroy reports `0000000000000000000000` as its local service ID. Entries in a
local `[local_server.config_stores.edgezero_runtime_env.contents]` block must
therefore use `EDGEZERO__SERVICES__0000000000000000000000__...`, not the
production service ID or the unscoped canonical key.

```toml
[stores.config]
ids     = ["app_config"]
# default = "app_config"   # required when ids.len() > 1
```

For local Viceroy testing, mirror the platform name in `fastly.toml`:

```toml
[local_server.config_stores.app_config]
format = "inline-toml"

[local_server.config_stores.app_config.contents]
greeting = "hello from config store"
```

Handlers read values through the `Config` extractor or `ctx.config_store(id)`:

```rust
async fn handler(config: Config) -> Result<Response, EdgeError> {
    let store = config.named("app_config").ok_or_else(|| EdgeError::service_unavailable("no `app_config`"))?;
    let greeting = store.get("greeting").await?.unwrap_or_default();
    // …
}
```

If a configured store link is missing, the adapter logs a one-time warning
and drops that id from the registry. Migrating from `name`/`adapters.*`?
See [the migration guide](../manifest-store-migration.md).

## Context Access

Access Fastly-specific APIs via the request context extensions:

```rust
use edgezero_core::context::RequestContext;
use edgezero_adapter_fastly::context::FastlyRequestContext;

async fn handler(ctx: RequestContext) -> Result<Response, EdgeError> {
    // Access Fastly context from extensions
    if let Some(fastly_ctx) = FastlyRequestContext::get(ctx.request()) {
        let client_ip = fastly_ctx.client_ip;
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Streaming

Fastly provides `stream_to_client`, but that API is incompatible with the standard
`#[fastly::main]` entrypoint used by generated projects. The current response converter therefore
collects `Body::stream` under a fixed 16 MiB cap before returning the final response. Outbound
response streams retain typed read/decode/deadline errors during that collection.

See the [Streaming guide](/guide/streaming) and
[capability matrix](/guide/capabilities#outbound-matrix) for the exact boundary.

## Testing

Run contract tests for the Fastly adapter:

```bash
cargo install viceroy --locked
export CARGO_TARGET_WASM32_WASIP1_RUNNER="viceroy run"

# Run tests
cargo test -p edgezero-adapter-fastly --features fastly --target wasm32-wasip1 --test contract
```

Fastly SDK-linked Wasm binaries require Viceroy for execution; plain Wasmtime
does not provide the `fastly_*` host imports needed by the adapter tests.

::: tip Local Execution
If Viceroy reports native certificate or keychain errors on macOS, use `--no-run`
locally and rely on Linux CI for execution.
